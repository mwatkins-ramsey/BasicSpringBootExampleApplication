This application currently uses just a Spring Boot application and a MySQL DB.
You should be able to run by first running `docker compose up` and then running the application in your IDE.

- MySql on port 33066 (mapped to 3306 of container)
- docker compose utilizes a volume with this DB, so it will persist DB changes between runs as long as the volume is
not deleted from your computer. The first time `docker-compose up` is ran, it will spawn the messaging database

In this sample app the intention is to support messages between users.  
A Message is just a string, and it always has one author identified by their user_id.  
A User has a first name, last name, and email address (all strings).  
A User can view any number of messages as long as they are listed as a viewer with the join table.  
so there should be a users table, a messages table, and a users_messages table.

Flyway is a tool which is used to do DB migrations, it is somewhat flexible and can be used in many different ways.
In this project, there is a plugin defined in the pom.xml which specifies a flyway configuration. This plugin allows
you to use maven to execute the migrations which is helpful locally. The connection info must match the DB configuration
in the docker compose file. This configuration would not typically be used in a CICD pipeline which would execute
flyway manually via a command.

Migration files can be found in src/main/resources/db/migration (your IDE might show it as db.migration)
